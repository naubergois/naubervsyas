## Research Foundation
- **HubSpot, 2024**: Content repurposed to 3+ formats sees 3.5x the total reach of single-channel content
- **LinkedIn algorithm, 2025**: Native text + image posts reach 5x more than link posts — never paste the YouTube URL as the primary content
- **Email, 2025 (Mailchimp benchmark)**: Tutorial/how-to newsletters average 35–45% open rate vs 22% industry avg
- **BrightEdge, 2025**: YouTube embed in blog post boosts that post's Google ranking by 53%
- **Shorts freshness decay**: 28–30 day cliff — clip and post Shorts within 7 days of long-form upload

## Platform Expansion Map

```
YouTube Video (long-form)
├── 1. YouTube Short (vertical, 30–60s clip)
├── 2. Blog Post (companion article, WordPress)
├── 3. LinkedIn Post (insight + native image)
├── 4. X Thread (5–7 tweets, step-by-step)
├── 5. Email Newsletter (value-first, CTA at end)
├── 6. Podcast Notes (audio script + show notes)
└── 7. YouTube Community Post (poll or preview teaser)
```

## Per-Platform Specs

### 1. YouTube Shorts (30–60s)
- **Best moment to clip**: The "before vs after" reveal or the most surprising feature
- **Format**: Hook in first 3s → quick demo → CTA ("full tutorial linked")
- **Title format**: `[The 1 thing they showed in 13 minutes] — 60 sec`
- **Post within 7 days** of main video to catch algorithm momentum

### 2. Blog Post
- Use `/youtube wp-post` for full pipeline
- Minimum 800 words with VideoObject schema
- H2 structure: What is [feature] + Step-by-step (pulled from timestamps) + Use cases + FAQs
- Embed the YouTube video above the fold
- Internal link to product pricing page

### 3. LinkedIn Post
- **Lead line**: The most counterintuitive thing from the video (no URL in first comment)
- **Format**: 3–5 short paragraphs, no bullet walls
- **Image**: Screenshot of the finished UI (dark background wins in LinkedIn feed)
- **CTA**: "Full tutorial in comments" — post YouTube link in first comment after posting
- **Best time**: Tuesday or Wednesday, 8–10 AM in the audience's timezone

### 4. X Thread
- **Tweet 1**: The hook — a surprising stat or result ("This nav menu took 6 minutes with zero CSS")
- **Tweets 2–5**: One step per tweet (pulled from timestamps — no jargon)
- **Tweet 6**: Before/after image
- **Tweet 7**: Link to full video + product link
- Keep each tweet under 240 chars — no thread walls

### 5. Email Newsletter
- **Subject line formula**: `[Benefit] in [Platform] — [Differentiator]` (e.g., "Horizontal scroll in Elementor — no GSAP, no code")
- **Structure**:
  - Opening: 2 sentences on the problem this solves
  - Visual: GIF or screenshot of result
  - 3-bullet summary of what they'll learn
  - CTA button: "Watch the Tutorial →"
  - Footer: Discount code [YOUR_DISCOUNT_CODE] reminder
- **Length**: Under 200 words — link to video, don't explain everything in email

### 6. Podcast Notes (if audio format is used)
- **Episode title**: Same as video title minus the year tag
- **Show notes structure**:
  - 1-paragraph summary
  - 3 key takeaways (pulled from "WHAT YOU'LL LEARN" bullets)
  - Resources mentioned (product URLs, docs, pricing)
  - Full transcript link (YouTube auto-captions URL)
- **Length**: 150–200 words for show notes

### 7. YouTube Community Post
- **Pre-release teaser** (post 24h before video goes live): Poll format — "Which part are you most interested in? [Option A from video] / [Option B]"
- **Post-release amplifier** (post 24h after video): Image of the finished result + "New tutorial just dropped — [1-line benefit]"
- **Community posts boost** Browse impressions for the video — post both
